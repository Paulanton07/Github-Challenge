## What I Built
I have built a crowd funding platform, currently in development but im submitting as a concept with mock data and no backend transacting functionality at present. 
I find it extremely exciting to build and develop concepts that others might find useful. 
I am fond of using the software that I make, I feel more connected to what I am doing

## My Experience with GitHub Copilot CLI

I like to start with a concept.txt or md file. I will then detail my vision/direction, and as much specific details for frameworks and languages to use (tech stack).

I also add any research gathered, and once the Copilot AI has ingested my idea, I make enquiries asking for options and advice, like "what would you do if?" or "what do you think about that?".

I then choose an option and start building, then edit and test until fully developed to my satisfaction. You can read more in the `concept.md` file found in the GitHub repo provided.

Even just filling out this submissions form has taught me a lot - this will be my very first entry to any kind of competition, ever, so it's a big moment for me!

Thank you for the opportunity, great fun to participate in this exciting event!
